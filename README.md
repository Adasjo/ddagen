# D-Dagen
Flask project for D-Dagen's website.

## General Guidelines

### Responsive Web Design
When designing a feature, design it with mobile first in mind.
Generally this means that you should never set values in pixels or cm, instead use %, em, rem, vh, and vw, more information can be found [here](https://www.w3schools.com/CSSref/css_units.asp). Yes, it is more work to design the site responsivley, but it creates a much better user experience.

## Setup
If you're running Windows I can highly recommend Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL) as
it allows you to run a Linux terminal in Windows. This can be of tremendous help as it allows you to gather everything related to the development of [ddagen.se](https://ddagen.se/) in one place (git, React, Flask).
