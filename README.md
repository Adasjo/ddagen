Flask project for D-Dagen's website.

Take a look at the [wiki](https://github.com/datasektionen/ddagen/wiki) for more information about the different features of [ddagen.se](https://ddagen.se)! 
While you're there make sure to contribute some information and documentation about new (and old) features. 

## Instalation
If you're running Windows I can highly recommend Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL, [https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10)) as it allows you to run a Linux terminal in Windows. This is helpful as it allows you to gather everything related 
to the development of [ddagen.se](https://ddagen.se/) in one place.

### Install dependencies
To install python 3 and flask run:
```bash
$ sudo apt install python3.9 python3-flask
```

## Run
To start the local development server run:
```
$Â flask run
```
