            <dd>The D-Dagen catalogue is given out to visitors in connection with the event every year.

                the participating companies. The catalogue contains a map over the placement of the company booths.
                This year the catalogue will be available in an electronic format at ddagen.se and only a condensed
                brochure will be printed in order to minimize our climate impact. The electronic catalogue will also
                allow for search- and filter functions and will increase the usability.<br><br>
