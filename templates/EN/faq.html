	<p class="info-text">The <a href="{{ url_for('static', filename='katalog2020.pdf') }}">D-Dagen catalogue </a> is given out to visitors in connection with the event every year. It is a collection of the most important information about the fair as well as information about the participating companies. The catalogue contains a map over the placement of the company booths. This year the catalogue will be available in an electronic format at ddagen.se and only a condensed brochure will be printed in order to minimize our climate impact. The electronic catalogue will also allow for search- and filter functions and will increase the usability.
