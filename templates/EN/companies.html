        <p class="cerise head">STEP 1</p>
        <p>The first step is to fill out the interest form.
            After the form is submitted you will receive an email informing you if you have received a spot at the fair.
            If you have been allocated a spot, an agreement will be attached in the email.

    </div>

    <div class="flex-box">
        <p class="cerise head">STEP 2</p>
        <p>The next step is to sign the contract (including the order information form), scan it within three (3) weeks and send it to <a class="cerise" href="mailto:d-dagen@d.kth.se">d&#8209;dagen@d.kth.se</a> with the title “Contract D-Dagen 2020 - [Company name]”. Please note that if  we do not receive the contract within 3 weeks from the date the contract is sent, your spot in the fair will be removed. </p>
    </div>

    <div class="flex-box">
