D-Dagen targets Computer Science students who want to get in contact with companies operating within the IT sector. The project group hopes to organize an interesting job fair which simplifies the meeting with the industry simple, no matter how far into their studies you are.

    <p> <span>Every year, the Computer Science Chapter at KTH organizes D-Dagen, which is a career fair where CS-students and companies get an outstanding chance to  connect and create a closer contact with each other. This year, the fair is held at Campus Valhallav√§gen during 10th of October. Later during the same evening, a traditional evening event is held, followed by a pub where the company representatives can get to know the students in a more relaxed environment. </span></p>
	<p>This year, Celab Communications provides D-Dagen with communications equipment for our personnel, which we are very grateful for!<br><br>
